        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The quickest, easiest, short-cut method of making Brazilian cheese bread is what I describe here 
            (and the only way some of my Brazilian friends make it). 
            You put the ingredients in a blender. Pour them out into a mini-muffin tin and bake.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beauty of this recipe is that you can make a big batch of batter and just store it in the refrigerator 
            (for up to a week), pouring out just as many mini-muffins as you want to eat. 
            You can even cook them in a toaster oven.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (170 g) tapioca flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (66 g) packed grated or crumbled cheese, your preference</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (or more to taste)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F and prepare a mini muffin tin</li>
            <li>Blend the ingredients into a batter</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the muffin tin</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until puffy and browned</li>
            <li>Let cool for several minutes</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
